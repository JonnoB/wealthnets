# A sketch of the global urban elite: Wealth sources and residential networks in 10 cities

This repo contains the code used to analuse the patterns of wealth from the ultra rich in 10 cities as part of the paper "A sketch of the global urban elite: Wealth sources and residential networks in 10 cities".

The code uses the openAI API to analyse the biographies of approximately 2000 ultra high-net worth individuals, and classify their sources of wealth into GICs classes. 

Several analytical techiniques are then applied to create a typography of wealth for the 10 cities which were analysed.

The repo is broken up into ipython notebooks that cover different aspects of the project.
- Cleaning PDFs
- getting embeddings and classifcation
- analysis
- network analysis

There is also the helper file containing the functions used to call the openAI APi

- call_gpt_helpers.py
