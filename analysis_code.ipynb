       "array([\"Modi Enterprises was founded as a family business by Ram Baksh Modi during the early 1800s; he passed away in 1857 and the business came into the control of his son, Chiranji Lal Modi, who provided supplies to the British cantonment from Kanpur to Peshawar, and shifted the headquarters of the business to Multan, British India. Grandson Multanimal Modi was a commission agent for food grains in Patiala, British India and expanded the business in the food grains sector. His son, Gujarmal Modi, was born in Kanaur, British India, and expanded the business in sectors including the chemical sector. His elder son Krishan Kumar Modi took control of his father's business after his demise in 1975. The family business was officially separated in 1989, and the various businesses were divided between the five sons of Gujarmal. Krishan Kumar diversified its portfolio to include tea, beverages, confectionery, cigarette manufacturing and pesticides. His wife Bina Modi is also involved in the family business. She concentrates on the restaurants, art and the fashion sectors. Their son Lalit Modi's early career included training at the Estee Lauder Companies and Philip Morris in the U.S.; returned to India in 1986 and worked at International Tobacco Company, a subsidiary of Godfrey Phillips India, and was promoted to be the President in 1987.
